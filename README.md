# 🏠 Map the Roomie

Map the Roomie is a simple frontend web project designed to help users find rooms and compatible roommates.  
The project focuses on clean UI, responsive design, and structured layout.

This project was created during my **second year of BTech** as a frontend practice project using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
